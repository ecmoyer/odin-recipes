        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for fried tofu is quick and easy to make, and is a great introduction to tofu.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 block extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp powdered ginger</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil or other cooking oil</li>
            <li>2-3 Tbsp tamari</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the block of tofu in half lengthwise, then slice each half into approximately 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick rectangles.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the flour and the powdered ginger.</li>
            <li>Coat all sides of each tofu rectangle in the flour and ginger mixture and place on a plate.</li>
            <li>Place a medium-sized frying pan on the stove on medium high heat. Add vegetable oil (or other cooking oil) to the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add the tofu to the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the tofu for approximately 3 minutes, or until just starting to brown, then flip the tofu and fry again until beginning to brown, approximately 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the tofu is light brown on both sides, lower the heat to as low as possible, then pour the tamari and sesame oil over the tofu.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
