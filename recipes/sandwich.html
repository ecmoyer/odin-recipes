        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everybody loves a good sandwich! Often attributed to the Earl of Sandwich, who wanted a food he could easily eat while gambling, the trusty sandwich can be enjoyed in all situations. This traditional variation, using peanut butter and jam, is a classic.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices of bread</li>
                <li>Peanut butter (or other nut butter)</li>
                <li>Jam (any flavour)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take one of your two pieces of bread, and use a knife to spread peanut butter on one side of it.</li>
                <li>Take your second piece of bread, and use a knife to spread jam on one side of it.</li>
                <li>Place your second piece of bread on top of your first piece of bread, so that the side of the bread with the jam covers the side of the other piece of bread with the peanut butter.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your sandwich!</li>
            </ol>
